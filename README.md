ResizeArrayT is an F# extension and module library for `ResizeArray<'T>` ( = `Collection.Generic.List<'T>`).<br>
It provides all the functions from the `Array` module in `FSharp.Core` for `ResizeArray`.<br>
And more.

It also works in Javascript and Typescript with [Fable](https://fable.io/).

This library was designed for use with F# scripting.<br>
Functions and methods never return null.<br>
When a function fails on invalid input it will throw a descriptive exception.<br>
Functions starting with `try...` will return an F# option.

I was always annoyed that an `IndexOutOfRangeException` does not include the actual bad index nor the actual size of the array.<br>
This library fixes that in the `resizeArray.Get`, `resizeArray.Set`, `resizeArray.Slice` and similar instance methods for item access.<br>
I made a similar a similar library for `array<'T>`: https://github.com/goswinr/ArrayT/ .

### Why ?
Yes, F#'s array and list modules can do these kind of operations on collections too.<br>
But ResizeArray, being mutable, still offers the best performance for collections that can expand & shrink and need random access via an index.<br>
In fact FSharp.Core uses [a very similar module internally](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/blob/main/src/Compiler/Utilities/ResizeArray.fs).

### It Includes:

- A `ResizeArray` module that has  **all**  functions from [`Array` module from `FSharp.Core`] reimplemented (https://fsharp.github.io/fsharp-core-docs/reference/fsharp-collections-arraymodule.html).<br>
 Including the sub module for Parallel computing.

- A Computational Expressions `resizeArray` that can be used like existing ones for `seq`.

- Support for F# slicing operator and indexing from the end. e.g: `items.[ 1 .. ^1]`.

- Extension members on `ResizeArray` like `.Get` `.Set` `.First` `.Last` `.SecondLast` and more.<br>
With nicer IndexOutOfRangeExceptions that include the bad index and the actual size.

- All Tests from the from `FSharp.Core`'s `Array` module ported and adapted to run in both javascript and dotnet.

### Namespace
The main namespace is `ResizeArrayT`.<br>
It was renamed from `ResizeArray` to `ResizeArrayT` in release 0.23. When used in scripting this helps avoid name collisions with the <br>
module inside of the same name. [Reference Issue].(https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/issues/17124)<br>

Older versions of the library will still work with the old namespace `ResizeArray`.<br>
And can be found on nuget.org with the name [ResizeArray](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ResizeArray/).<br>


### Usage
Just open the namespace

```fsharp
open ResizeArrayT
```
this namespace contains:
- a module also called `ResizeArray`
- a  Computational Expressions called `resizeArray`
- this will also auto open the extension members on `ResizeArray<'T>`

then you can do:

```fsharp
let evenNumbers =
    resizeArray {  // a Computational Expression like seq
        for i = 0 to 99 do
            if i % 2 = 0 then
                i
    }

let oddNumbers = evenNumbers |> ResizeArray.map (fun x -> x + 1) // ResizeArray module

let hundred = oddNumbers.Last // Extension member to access the last item in the list

```

### Tests
All Tests run in both javascript and dotnet.
Successful Fable compilation to typescript is verified too.
Go to the tests folder:

```bash
cd Tests
```

For testing with .NET using Expecto:

```bash
dotnet run
```

for JS testing with Fable.Mocha and TS verification:

```bash
npm test
```
